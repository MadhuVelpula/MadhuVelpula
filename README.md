About Project: Our Project is about,where 
  -> It makes the user use tech at the click of a button.
  -> Encourage them to learn more about such Tech
  -> It Provides Support for those geeks who feel learning new tech. 
  -> Raise Innovative ideas on more Integrations.
It's Motto:
  -> To make linux Easier.
  -> Make Technologies useful and non-technical Communities.
  -> Easy Integrations of Tech.
  -> Emotional Boost for new learners.
Introduction:
  -> It describes a wide range of Technologies that reduce human intervention in
      Processes. It has been achieved by Various devices and computers,usually in Combination.
  -> Automation is about implementing a system to complete repetitive and easily replicated tasks
     without human References
  -> It Saves time and improves agility.
System Requirements:
  System             Minimum           Recommended 
  Processor          Intel core i3     Intel core i5
                     or Comparable     or Comparable 
  RAM                4GB               8GB or more 
  Hard Drive Space   10GB              15GB or more 
  Graphics           XGA(1024×768)      HD1080(1920×1080) or more.
Setting up the Environment: Basically,these are four Methods,
    1. Installation of Automation Tools:These tools can automate the installation and configuration 
         of a workstation's services,Tools and Configuration files.
           For Example: Puppet,Smart Frog,Shell Scripts,Install Packages.
    2.  Disk Images: Disk Imaging Software is a common solution for storing an image of a configured 
           host that Can be restored to other hosts.
    3.  Virtualization: These can be used to create Virtual Machine images with various configurations 
           and installations.
    4.  Source Code Control: The Final step for an automated process usually entails source Code Control.
           Developers might also want to Check-in helper infrastructure and setting for their tools.
Features it has: Linux,Docker and Kubernetes.
Future Scope: 
     Future Integrations: Further Integrations Possible.
             -> Jenkins.
             -> Ansible.
             -> Cloud Computing platforms- AWS,Azure,GCP.
             -> Grafana,Prometheus.
             -> ELK Stack.
             -> Git Hub and etc.,
     Future Features: that can be added.
             -> Create a web UI along with TUI.
             -> Create a mobile UI along with TUI.
             -> Add more Features.
             -> Can Convert into Virtual Assistant.
             -> Can be Integrated with ML for interesting Assistant.
